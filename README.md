# Godot Custom Scene Launcher

Add a button to run any custom scene, next to the buttons to run the current and main scene. Original plugin for Godot 3 by Xananax.

## Basic Usage

At first, using this plugin isn't different from `Play Scene` button (<kbd>F6</kbd>)</kbd>).

However, by pressing the "pin" icon, you will prevent the scene from changing as you navigate to new tabs.
